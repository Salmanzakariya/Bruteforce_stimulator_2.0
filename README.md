# Bruteforce_stimulator_2.0
Developed a brute-force simulator using Python's `itertools` to generate and test combinations of characters efficiently. This tool mimics password cracking attempts, allowing security testing by iterating through all possible passwords within a defined character set. Ideal for ethical hacking and Cybersecurity. #Cybersecurity #EthicalHacking
